# Kotlin NADE Game Engine

This game engine will be my biggest challenge yet. I plan to have full support for technologies such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Direct 3D and WebGL. On top of this I also plan to have smart resource management and different levels of features from complex to beginner to make this engine as dynamic and powerful as it can be.
